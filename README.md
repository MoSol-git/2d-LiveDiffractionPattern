# 2d-LiveDiffractionPattern

This educational program shows live diffraction patterns obtained by a webcam or other video sources.
It can be used for educational purposes, as students can see the input and output at the same time. 
A desired pattern such as random, periodic, FCC, BCC,
Hexagonal etc., can simply be drawn on a piece of paper, and by holding it in front of the camera, the resulting diffraction pattern can be seen.
With a sufficient amount of light illuminating the subject, the signal to noise ratio will be higher.
